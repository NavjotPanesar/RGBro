# RGBro
A windows utility that communicates with an arduino over USB to crossfade RGB LEDs via PWM.

Include the code for the associated arduino sketch.

Currently the code is unorganized on the arduino side. 
The C# code for the windows client is neater, but still needs work (need to handle connection corner cases and overall SerialPort object better)
